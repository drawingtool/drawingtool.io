      <p1>Drawing is a universal language. This project aims to use drawing as a tool to provide a space for open discussion about topics people find difficult to verbalise*. 
          Use this in tool workshops, discussion spaces, classrooms or the dinner table. Visualise your definition of a subject and compare with society's opinions of said topic.<br><br>
          This website accepted submissions for 3 months, constantly collecting the opinions<br> of users <i>anonymously</i>. The archive now hosts all user submissions and the content was collated and printed into a publication archiving today's opinions.<br>
